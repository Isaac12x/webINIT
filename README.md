Basic initalization of web components

<<<<<<< HEAD
In this templates I had initialized to create a functional HTML boilerplate, ready to start coding the page iteself. MAYUS text is used as a placeholder, change it to whatever your site is about.

If you don't like something, just remove it ASAP.

There is a sublime snippet which triggers the template just by typing HTMLinti+Tab. You can change the trigger name inside the setup.sublime-snippet on <tabTrigger>YOUR-TRIGGERNAME</tabTrigger> (located on the end of the page).
The sublime snippet must be added inside sublime by: Sublime>Preferences>BrowsePackages>User>Copy here.

If the User folder doesn't exist, create it and copy the snippet there.

#Happy coding :)



NOTE: for assets, images and scripts the better way to store them would be un a CDN. For integrating scripts would be useful to search here https://cdnjs.com/ and implement the url into 

E.g.: \<script src="url" type="text/javascript"\> \</script\>
