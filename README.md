# webINIT
Basic initalization of web components

In this templates I had initialized 


There is a sublime snippet which triggers the template just by typing HTMLinti+Tab. You can change the trigger name inside the setup.sublime-snippet on <tabTrigger>YOUR-TRIGGERNAME</tabTrigger> (located on the end of the page).
The sublime snippet must be added inside sublime by: Sublime>Preferences>BrowsePackages>User>Copy here.
If the User folder doesn't exist, create it ASAP, then copy the snippet there.

#Happy coding :)



NOTE: for assets, images and scripts the better way to store them would be un a CDN. For integrating scripts would be useful to search here https://cdnjs.com/ and implement the url into 

E.g.: <script src="url" type="text/javascript"></script>
